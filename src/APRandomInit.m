function [ C ] = APRandomInit( l, O, L_done )
%APRandomInit Initialise the parameters of an access point
%   l [in]      - Recursion level (5 -> 1 for R2 -> R6 respectively)
%   O [in]      - Matrix of RSSI values from known locations relevant to
%       to this Access Point (RSSI, X_long, X_lat)
%   L_done [in] - Set of location IDs for which their position is known
%   C [out]     - Vector of calculated AP parameters:
%       c longtitude, c latitude, transmit power, path loss rate
